# website-assigment
For this assigment I created a website about who is the greatest soccer player.

first step was creating the html file using
the appropriete tags.
Fisrt was the header tag, whitin the header tag i created a H1 then a nav tag where i put the navigation, about me, contact, resume and work

After finnishing the html part I created a style.css file which i used to modify the style and the placement of my blocks. then i added some images.
